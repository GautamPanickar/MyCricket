What is a follow-on?     &#xa;&#x9;If the side batting first in a two-innings match, whether a Test match or a first-class match, &#xa;dismisses their opponents to retain a lead of 200 runs in a five-day match, 150 in a three- or four-day &#xa;match, 100 in a two-day match and 75 in a one-day match, they have the option of enforcing a follow-on. &#xa;This requires the second team to follow their second innings immediately as the first one is over. &#xa;The rule can be best explained by an example. Imagine that in a five-day Test match, Team A batted first &#xa;and got 450 runs in their first innings. When Team B bats in their first innings, their first target is &#xa;to get within 200 runs of Team A&apos;s score, that is, 251. Otherwise, Team A will have the option of &#xa;enforcing a follow-on. If Team B are all out for 250 or less (having a deficit of 200 or more), and are &#xa;asked to follow on, they will have to bat again immediately. The idea is to give the side having the &#xa;requisite lead the option of dismissing their opponents and finishing the game without themselves &#xa;having to bat again. If they are successful, they are said to have won by an innings.&#xa;&#xa;2. What are the fielding restrictions in one-day cricket?    &#xa;&#x9;In one-day cricket, special fielding restrictions come into play in the first 15 overs of each &#xa;innings. During this time, the fielding side must have at least two fielders in close-in catching &#xa;positions, that is, within 15 yards of the stumps at the batting end. Also, a maximum of two players&#xa;are allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle. From the 16th over these restrictions are lifted and &#xa;the fielding side may take out the close-in fielders if they wish. However, at least four fielders &#xa;must remain inside the 30-yard circle at all times. Another fielding restriction, of course, is that &#xa;each bowler is allowed only a restricted number of overs. For example, in a 50-over one- day match a &#xa;bowler can have a maximum of 10 overs. &#xa;&#xa;3. What is the 30-yard circle and the 15-yard circle?    &#xa;&#x9;In one-day cricket, to demarcate the fielding area for the fielding restrictions, the 30-yard &#xa;circle and 15-yard circle are taken as markers. The 15-yard limit is marked at both ends of the pitch,&#xa; having a radius of 15 yards from either set of wickets. It is not mandatory to mark this circle. &#xa;Sometimes just guide marks are made on the field to indicate to fielders where the 15-yard limit is. &#xa;If not, it remains to the discretion of the umpires and players. There is one 30-yard circle that &#xa;encompasses the 15-yard circles/areas and the pitch. It is at a distance of 30-yards from the nearest &#xa;wickets. All one-day games require this area to be demarcated. &#xa;&#xa;4. Are there any fielding restrictions in Test cricket?    &#xa;&#x9;Yes, there are, though there are no 15-yard or 30-yard demarcations in Test cricket. Only two &#xa;fielders are allowed behind the batsmen on the leg-side. This rule is a legacy of the Bodyline series&#xa; of 1932-33, when English fast bowlers under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine were directed to bowl &#xa;short at the batsmen&apos;s body. The leg-side would then be packed with fielders, waiting for the catches &#xa;that came from batsmen fending the ball away. (This rule is also applicable to one-day cricket.) &#xa;&#xa;5. What is the size of a cricket field?  &#xa;&#x9;This might sound strange, but there are no regulations for the size of a cricket field! The &#xa;laws of cricket make no mention of the distance of the boundary from the centre apart from stating that&#xa; both captains and umpires must agree on the boundary line before the toss. Also, it says, if possible,&#xa; the boundary should be marked with a white line or a rope. &#xa;&#xa;6. What is the size of a cricket pitch?    &#xa;&#x9;The cricket pitch measures 22 yards or 20.12 metres in length and 5 feet or 1.52 metres in &#xa;width. The length is measured between the middle stumps of each set of wickets at each end. &#xa;&#xa;7. What is a crease?    &#xa;&#x9;There is in fact the bowling crease, the popping crease and the return crease marked on a &#xa;cricket pitch at both ends. The bowling crease is marked in line with the three stumps at both ends. &#xa;It is 8 feet 8 inches in length (or 2.64m), and the stumps are in the centre. The popping crease is &#xa;parallel to and in front of the bowling crease, at a distance of 4 feet from it. The marking of the &#xa;popping crease has to be at least 6 feet (1.22m) in length on either side of the wicket. However, it &#xa;is considered to be unlimited in length on either side of the wicket. This is the line on which the &#xa;batsman takes guard. During run outs and stumpings this is the crease that comes into play, with the &#xa;batsman said to have made his or her ground only if they are behind the line of the popping crease. &#xa;Also, some part of the bowler&apos;s front foot must be behind the line of the popping crease during &#xa;delivery, otherwise a no-ball is called. The return crease is marked at each edge of the bowling &#xa;crease, perpendicular to it. It extends at least 4 feet (1.22m) behind the bowling crease, and a &#xa;forward extension up to the popping crease is usually marked as well. The return crease is also &#xa;considered unlimited in length. A bowler&apos;s back foot needs to be inside the return crease, not &#xa;touching it, while delivering a ball. Otherwise, it is a no-ball. &#xa;&#xa;8. What is the height of the stumps? How far apart are they?   &#xa;&#x9;There are two sets of wickets on each end of the cricket pitch, exactly 22 yards apart, &#xa;each made up three wooden stumps and two wooden bails. The stump that is towards the off side is&#xa; the off stump, the one in the middle is the middle stump and the one towards the leg side the leg &#xa;stump. All three stumps are of equal size and 28 inches (71.1cm) in height. The bails are 4 3/8 inches&#xa; (11.1cm) in length and must not project from the top of the stumps by more than 1/2 inch (1.3cm). &#xa;Each set of wickets is 9 inches (22.86cm) wide, while the stumps are of sufficient thickness not to &#xa;allow the ball to pass between them. &#xa;&#xa;9. How many umpires and other officials for a game of cricket?    &#xa;&#x9;Cricket can basically be played with just two field umpires. However, these days in i&#xa;nternational games, both one-day and Tests, apart from the field umpires, a television umpire,&#xa; a reserve fourth umpire and a match referee is also required. The field umpires are responsible &#xa;for taking decisions on the field. If they want, they can refer to the TV umpire for help. The &#xa;fourth umpire is, of course, on standby in case one of the others is indisposed. The match referee &#xa;is responsible for keeping an eye on the play and seeing that the game is played in a fair manner. &#xa;&#xa;10. What is the difference between on-side, leg-side and off-side?    &#xa;&#x9;Consider the entire cricket field divided into two halves by an imaginary line drawn through&#xa; both sets of stumps along the pitch. The side of the field that is behind the batsman when he or she&#xa;is facing the bowler is the on-side or the leg-side. The side that is in front of the batsman when he &#xa;or she takes guard is, therefore, the off-side. This also explains certain fielding positions, such as&#xa; mid-on, mid- off, long-on and long-off. Obviously, this means that a right-handed batsman&apos;s on-side &#xa;is a left-hander&apos;s leg-side. Another way of explaining this is that a right-hand batsman standing in &#xa;front of his or her stumps facing the bowler&apos;s end will have the off-side on the right and the on-side&#xa; on the left. For a left- hander it is the other way round. &#xa;&#xa;11. What is the difference between leg-spin and off-spin? &#xa;&#x9;A right-hand batsman facing a right-arm leg-spin bowler will have the ball pitching and then &#xa;spinning away from him. Such a delivery is called leg-spin as it spins from the leg-side to the off- &#xa;side. Off-spin, on the other hand, spins from the off-side to the leg-side for a right-hand batsman. &#xa;&#xa;12. What is a googly?    &#xa;&#x9;The leg-spinner&apos;s &apos;wrong one&apos; is called the googly. Instead of making the ball turn from &#xa;the leg-side to the off-side, the bowler makes it go the other way, thus confusing the batsman. &#xa;&#xa;13. What is the difference between seam and swing bowling?   &#xa;&#x9;Seam bowling is when a bowler makes use of the seam of the cricket ball to get movement &#xa;off the pitch. If the ball is delivered to hit the pitch at a certain angle, various deviations &#xa;may be caused. Highly skilled seam bowlers can control these deviations. Swing bowling, on the &#xa;other hand, is when a bowler is able to move the ball in the air. It is called in-swing if it swings&#xa; inwards and out- swing if it goes the other way. Swing can be controlled by keeping one side of the &#xa;ball well polished and shining and allowing the other side to scruff up naturally in the course of &#xa;the game. This causes increased turbulence on the scruffed up side as compared to the smooth side, &#xa;dragging the ball to one side while it is travelling. Again, controlled swing bowling requires a high &#xa;level of skill. &#xa;&#xa;14. What is chucking? Why is it illegal?    &#xa;&#x9;Chucking or throwing is an illegal delivery in cricket. A bowler is said to be chucking if &#xa;there is a full or partial straightening of the arm during the delivery of the ball just before the &#xa;ball leaves the hand. It is illegal because it gives the bowler an unfair advantage in imparting &#xa;extra speed or spin to the ball. One of the first victims of this law was Australian Ian Meckiff.&#xa; He was called for throwing even though his arm was naturally bent, and ultimately gave up cricket. &#xa;Of course, today throwing is a major simmering controversy in cricket. If the same parameters that &#xa;applied to Meckiff were taken into consideration, bowlers like Sri Lankan Muralitharan or Pakistani &#xa;Shoaib Akhtar would not be allowed to bowl. &#xa;&#xa;15. In how many ways can a batsman be out?    &#xa;&#x9;A batsman can be out in 10 different ways. These are: bowled, caught, stumped, run out, &#xa;leg before wicket, hit wicket, hit the ball twice, obstructing the field, handled the ball and &#xa;timed out. &#xa;&#xa;16. What is the &apos;danger area&apos; of the pitch?    &#xa;&#x9;The &apos;danger area&apos; is an imaginary 4 feet by 2 feet area on both sides of the pitch just &#xa;in front of the stumps that must be protected from damage by the bowlers and fielders. This is 4 &#xa;feet (1.22m) from the popping crease, and within 1 foot (30.48m) from either side of the middle stump. &#xa;&#xa;17. What are the Ashes?    &#xa;&#x9;The Ashes are the oldest cricketing competition in the world, played annually between &#xa;traditional rivals Australia and England. Tired of getting beaten by Australia, an English newspaper,&#xa; The Sporting Times, in 1882 published an &apos;obituary&apos; of English cricket, saying that it &apos;died at the &#xa;Oval on 29 August 1882&apos; and was &apos;deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and &#xa;acquaintances&apos;. It ended by saying that the body would be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. &#xa;Thus, the Ashes were born. The trophy is a small urn containing the &apos;ashes&apos; of English cricket. &#xa;There is a little controversy as to its contents though. Some people say that it contains the ashes&#xa; of a burnt bail, while some say that is was a burnt veil. However, much to the displeasure of many &#xa;Australians, the Ashes urn is not allowed to be moved out of Lords! &#xa;&#xa;18. What is Bodyline?    &#xa;&#x9;The Ashes series of 1932-33 is referred to as the Bodyline series. This is so because the &#xa;English side touring Australia under Douglas Jardine used what they called the &apos;leg theory&apos; to keep&#xa; Australian batsmen, mainly one Donald Bradman, under wraps. It involved their fast bowlers sending &#xa;down fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman&apos;s body, with the leg side packed with fielders.&#xa; The batsman had little choice but to fend off the ball straight to the waiting fielders behind him,&#xa; or to get hit very painfully. This was probably cricket&apos;s first scandal. It very nearly broke &#xa;cricketing relations between Australia and England. England were successful in winning back the &#xa;Ashes and Don Bradman &apos;failed&apos;, scoring at a measly rate of 56.67. &#xa;&#xa;19. What is underarm bowling? Is it legal?    &#xa;&#x9;Underarm bowling means that a ball must be delivered with the hand below the level of &#xa;the elbow. Believe it or not, this was originally how cricket was played. It was only in the &#xa;early 1800s that a man called John Willes tried out an over-arm or round-arm action that shocked &#xa;everyone. His inspiration was his sister who used to bowl to him, but because of her skirt she &#xa;found it hard to underarm. However, this new method was declared &apos;dangerous&apos; and &apos;unfair&apos;! In 1835 &#xa;the rule was finally changed, with bowlers now allowed to raise their arms, but only to shoulder level.&#xa; It was only in 1864 that MCC allowed the bowlers&apos; arms to be raised to any level. Today underarm &#xa;bowling is allowed only in blind cricket. A bowler bowling underarm in any other competition is illegal.&#xa;&#xa;This is not an exhaustive FAQ on cricket.
